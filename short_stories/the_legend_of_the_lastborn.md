##The Legend of the Lastborn

For 100,000 years, the wee folk held mastery over the wilds. Gently, they liaised with beast and plant to maintain the balance of nature, so that all might be blessed with her bounties. None questioned the wisdom of the feyborn Gnomish druids. 

For 50,000 years, the children of the stars had lifted mana from the ley lines, weaving it into untold beauty and magnificence. Their ethereal songs were the delight of the first age, an artwork that took a millennia to master. None questioned the inspiration of the highborn Elven sorcerers. 

For 10,000 years the sons of stone had excavated the earth, delving deeper than any before them to discover marvelous minerals that could be worked into mighty materials hitherto unheard of. The artisans of the deep were unmatched in all the land in the patient excellence of their crafts. None question the mastery of the deepborn Dwarves.

For 5,000 years, the tribes of the man wandered the world, subsisting their short, violent lives as best they could. Born last, and without the gifts of their siblings, the found themselves set against a vast and hostile world, with nothing but each other to make their way. None questioned the impotence of the lastborn Human pilgrims.

The Gnomes tutted at their futile attempts to subvert the dominion of natural law; wheresoever nature placed a barrier, the tribes of the man would throw themselves helplessly at it, building walls, dams, canals, fences, and fields. They ignored the wisdom of the feyborn, and were mocked for their foolishness. But they did eat.

The Elves chuckled at the primitive incantations of the tribes of men; hardly true magic, the tribes of men would lace their petty conjurations with empty ceremony, calling upon the blessing of imaginary benefactors. They ignored the inspiration of the highborn, and were mocked for their superstition. But they did worship.

The Dwarves snorted at the shoddy works of man; with little regard for perfection, they hacked away at insulting approximations of dwarven steel, happy to mass manufacture an inferior product that could be replaced when it inevitably failed. They ignored the mastery of the deepborn, and were mocked for their primitiveness. But they did arm themselves.

Of course, Gnomes are a rare sight in the dwindling remnants of the great woods of old these days; and the legendary songs of Elves have long fallen silent over the night skies; and few behold the masterworks of the Dwarves anymore. The foolish, superstitious, and primitive Humans had pushed back the untamed wilds, spread vast and devoted religions, and conquered the lands of the earth with immense armies. What elder folk remain, retreat to the deepest woods, the darkest mines, and furthest isles. There they speak in hushed tones: _woe unto ye who underestimates the lastborn_.
