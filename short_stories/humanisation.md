##Humanisation

The burly Forsidian veteran smacked the table, "WHAM! Just like that, we crushed the humans." 

"J-just like that?" stammered Cyrus, one of the huddled Forsidian cadets.

"Yep. Just. Like. That," repeated Gorit with emphasis, elaborating, "it was the battle to end all battles, everything in the human wars had led to this." 

"Why did the humans lose? Was it because they were an inferior species?" asked Cyrus, wide eyed. Gorit chuckled, "Yes and no. The humans just overestimated themselves, a common mistake made by young races. Still, obviously all races are inferior in the face of Forsidian military might-"

"Yeah yeah, somebody has to man the federation's guns. You just be grateful we don't have Forsidian diners, ok Gorit?" Gorit's story was cut short by the sarcastic rhetorical questioning of the Lursid waitress, Ursula. "I didn't mean inferior like that, Ursula. Just, different, you know," Gorit reasoned, gesturing to the cadets, "the humans lost earth for a reason - a lot of reasons. There's lessons to be learned!" Gorit smacked the diner table again, for emphasis.

"Ok, ok, big shot. Whaddaya want to drink?" retorted Ursula.

"I'll have a Stout, baby," answered Gorit, "and the cadets can have glorpsap." The cadets groaned. "I want a milkshake," protested Cyrus, "and Kanye-Bob only drinks coke; he's like allergic to glorpsap, or something." Kanye-Bob furiously shoot his eyestalks in agreement. "Alright, alright, give 'em all milkshakes, and coke for Kanye-Bob," surrendered Gorit, "anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, how the defeat of humanity was-"

"Anything to eat?" interrupted Ursula, with a smirk, as she chewed on her lip piercing. The cadets looked to Gorit with anticipation. "The other troop captains never let us have pizza. Can we have pizza?"  pleaded Hillary, the youngest cadet. Gorit did like Pepperoni, "alright alright, but if we're getting pizza, it's going to be pepperoni. None of you babies better cry that it's too spicy. Also, I'll have an IPA instead of a stout." Ursula jotted the order down in her moleskine notepad, bouncing her tentacles affirmatively, "thanks, partner!"

Gorit loosened his tie a little, groaning as he refocused, "right, so uh..."

"THE HUMANS!" Cried out Cyrus, Kanye-Bob, and Madonna all at once. Gorit cleared his throat gruffly, "yes, right. Well the humans overestimated themselves. That was their downfall. They imagined that they were different, special, fated, exempt to statistics, blessed with unmatched intellect, unpredictable ingenuity, unique creativity..." Gorit waved his claw, "you get the idea. It's tempting to think of ourselves as the heroes of our own story-"

"Like Simba?" asked Madonna.

"Yes! Like Simba," grinned Gorit, "in the movies, Simba overcomes all odds and saves the kingdom from his evil uncle Scar. It's a fun story, but what happens in the real world when Simba comes back from exile expecting to overthrow Scar simply because that is just, and he is special?"

The cadets looked at Gorit with glassy eyestalks.

"RIPPED TO SHREDS BY HYENAS!" Gorit roared, with a laugh. "Bummer," remarked Cyrus. "Yeah, like totally not radical," added Kanye-bob. Madonna sulked.

"The truth is, cadets, the humans weren't the best at anything. They should have recognised that, and abased themselves to the Forsidian Federation, like so many conquered races before them. Instead, they threw it all away for the sake of pride," Gorits tone became more somber, "and now half of earth is uninhabitable, and the result is the same: they are conquered, crushed, insignificant."

Ursula slid the giant pizza onto the table, causing Gorit to groan, "Chicago crust?! Ugh." Ursula put her tentacle on her hip, "ugh, New York Style is overrated, just give it a shot. I promise it's not the same as Pizza Hut deep pan." Gorit smacked Kanye-bob's hand, "hold it buddy, what comes first?" Kanye-bob groaned and clasped his claws together against his eyestalks, "we thank you lord for giving us this food..."
