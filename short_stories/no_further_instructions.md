*"QUIT! STOP! SURRENDER!"*

Fire, Ice, and Acid bit into the Golem's chassis as he ineffectually strode, flailed, and tossed about the top chamber of Ristinar's tower. Ristinar was deceptively spry, defying his lengthy beared and withered age with lightning fast leaps to avoid the lumbering construct. As he darted from column to column, ducking to avoid hurtling furniture tossed at him by the rampaging artifice, Ristinar slung conjured bolts of various energies at his adversary's reinforced frame.

*"CEASE! BACK! RETURN!"*

Ristinar had hoped to wear the golem down but, in credit to his own craftsmanship, the golem was just too well made. He found himself deeply regretting venturing so deep into the Infernus to source the everdeep obsidian glaze, now repelling his spells with great effect.

*"DEFEND! CLEAN! COOK!"*

Ristinar tried some of the more recent commands, in hope of setting the automation back on track. Who was animating it? Perhaps the imp in the Iron city of Dis that sold him the ember ruby to power it? Or maybe his arch-rival, Nemrenix? Sprinting about the circular chamber, Ristinar dragged the tip of his staff along the ground behind him.

*"BY THE POWER OF HELLFIRE, I ABJURE THEE, FOOL! YIELD, AND REVEAL THINESELF!"*

Ristinar skidded to a halt, and slammed his staff into the ground, activating the circle of binding he'd deftly inscribed into a glowing rune of power. The enchanted sigil would ensnare whatsoever malevolent force was controlling the golem, penetrating planar boundaries and anchoring it in place. Ristinar exhaled, and leant against his staff, "honestly, nice effort. Easily the best attempt on my life yet, and I have some pretty formidable enemies. So, tell me, to who do I owe the honour?"

**"no further instructions"**

Ristinar's eyes widened as the golem *spoke*, then effortlessly strode across the shimmering barrier. In a single sweep, it plucked the staff from the Wizard's grasp and snapped it in its fist. "No, wait-"

**"no further instructions"**
