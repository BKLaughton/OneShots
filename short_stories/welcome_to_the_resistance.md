## "Welcome to the Resistance."

> ######Prompt:
> War breaks out, humans lose, earth is antimattered, but not before several exodus fleets escape in different directions into the galaxy.
  
>  Humans are fugitive outlaws through no fault of their own (but because of a very reasonable law). Their very existence is illegal, but they are not without allies. In the galactic fringes and frontiers, where central authority is weakest, they are plentiful. Humans also find safe harbours in worlds that chafe against galactic authority, and those that see the unprovoked genocide against the humans for what it was.
  
>  Still, the full power of the law is engaged in an endless manhunt, seeing humanity as a contamination of violence that has infested the galaxy. Bounty hunters collect handsome rewards for turning in humans, too.
The humans are not helpless, however. Moreso than any other race in the galactic community, they possess a natural talent for war. Much of the scattered human resistance engages in piracy and guerilla warfare. Moreover, the humans have leveraged the secret to evading quarantine to slowly make contact with and build an allied network of suitable quarantined species.
Would love to play a game in this setting.

Glch'xu suppressed his limbic system, which simultaneously made him feel nauseus, whilst also calming the twitching of his antennae. The QE officer wasn't a yhaurid (or even an arthropod), but it was important that he appear calm.

"Licence and registration," the officer hadn't even lifted his visor, or stopped to address him personally. Glch'xu scuttered over to his desk, stammeringly requesting a member of the Customs Inspection team to allow him to fetch the documents from his administrative platform (which was a mess of datashards). After some rifling, Glch'xu presented the accreditation, "j-just a freighter, like I said on the intercomm. I could've transferred these files-"

"What are you doing in Quaril sector? Says here you're running plutonium from Deflot-3 to..." the QE officer flicked through the holographically projected registration.
"-to the core. I just took a little detour, there's this great snorf diner not three parsecs counterwise. You guys should really try it out- you eat snorf, right? I think I've got some coupons around here..." Glch'xu fumbled though the mound of data shards as he suppressed the urge to vomit, the customs team were popping cylinders down on the hold level.

"You okay there-" the QE inspector flicked back to the top of the registration document before shoving it back towards the queasy arthropod, "-Glch'xu? Your antennae are looking a little erratic."

Glch'xu's compound eyes darted up to his antennae: steady, shit. The QE officer grunted with vindication as one of his team whistled something in illistzan. "Fnerbron says he found a pretty hefty stack of cobant leaves. Care to explain that?" the officer glared at him expectantly. "Wha-? Oh, yes. Uh, well. The thing is-" Glch'xu opened his mandibles as if to speak, but only dryness and silence came out.
"Paid in advance, maybe?" the officer offered. "Yes!" exclaimed Glch'xu, leaping on the explanation. The officer nodded, half-swivelling as if to leave before adding, "-not for this run, though, right? Because those records you just gave me had the plutonium as COD." Glch'xu was no expert on yhaurid anatomy, but the officer seemed to smirking, "right, COD. No, yes, well those leaves are an advance payment... just not for the shipment."

The officer folded it's tentacles, turning back to face Glch'xu in anticipation. "The thing is, I like to gamble. Well I don't like it, or do it, except for this one time, and, and, well I won-" 

The officer interrupted Glch'xu, "gambling, huh? That's a class M crime. Not many folks fess up to something like that. I'm going to have to write you up; you'll probably lose most of that stack of leaves for the fine."
Glch'xu shrugged, "yep, well, do the crime , pay the fine, right? My bad. Actually, I don't even know what I was thinking. You know, I'm glad you stopped me; turned me off this path before I-"

"Started smuggling biologicals?" interjected the officer. Glch'xu vomited. The officer produced an inhibitor brace, "you're in a lot of trouble, Glch'xu. You know what I think? I think you're an ok bug. I think you made a mistake, got mixed up in something, maybe even blackmailed. You don't strike me as resistance material, and humans don't take so well to bugs. You've got a mighty big hold down there, and being the violent and unstable species they are, any humans hiding out there are likely to lash out at my guys. If you knew where they were, and told me, maybe we could write it up like you got threatened- no, forced into it."
"F-f-f-forced?" Glch'xu's mandibled clattered the word out as he braced himself over the neon puddle of digestive fluid.
"That's option A. Option B is we can do this by the book: I put this inhibitor brace on you, we find and subdue the contraband biologicals, and you get slapped with violation of quarantine," the officer slapped the arthropod on the back, triggering another bout of vomiting, "that's a class A crime! the choice is yours, friend." 

Glch'xu's antennae were jittering like wild, no longer suppressed. He did not sign up for this. Hell, he was hardly a human-sympathiser; sure, what happened to them was bad, but it was at least part their fault for fighting back. He'd only agreed to smuggle the humans because the vnodian dispatch clerk said it was easy leaves, that all the freighters do it.

"So, how we going to do this?" the officer was getting impatient, and his inhibitor brace was fully charged, "option A, or option B?"

"When in doubt, pick C," **BLAM!** The officer pattered down over Glch'xu's hunched form in a mix of snotty globules and green mist, mostly mixing in with the yhaurid vomit. Standing in his place was one of the humans, clutching something big and angry - a weapon!
"W-W-W-WHAT DID YOU DO?! YOU HAVE WEAPONS?! YOU SAID YOU WERE NON-COMBATANTS!" Glch'xu gripped his compound eyes in despair. "Ain't no such thing as a non-combatant human, bugboy. You think mould farmers have the kind of dough we paid you for passage?"

"W-What about the others?" Glch'xu stuttered fearfully. **Blam-blam-blam-blam!** The human raised it's eyebrows as it peered over the railing, down to the hold from whence the chain of blaster fire roared, looked back and shrugged.

Glch'xu started chirping in despair, "please don't kill me! Please!"

"Don't worry, Glitchy, we don't hurt our friends. We're still friends, right?" the human pulled back the bulky firearm, and offered a hand up. Glch'xu stared at it, bewildered, before bursting into chirps again, "Br-r-r-r-r-rrrrr, you might as well kill me; I'm ruined! Customs already logged and broadcasted my ship registration and ID, when they don't report in, I'm, I'm-"

"-fucked, yep. We best get going," agreed the human. The other fugitives emerged upon the bridge, all speckled green and grinning. "G-get going?" Glch'xu stammered, "b-but-"

"You said it, bigeyes," chimed in one of the other humans, a female "you're as much a fugitive as we are, now. Or soon you will be, I figure we've got a few cycles before there's a bughunt for you. So we best get to the core before then. Oh, and we're going to make a couple of detours on the way. Welcome to the resistance!"
